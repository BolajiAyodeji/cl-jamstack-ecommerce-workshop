# Jamstack eCommerce 101

Digital commerce has changed, and there is an increasing demand for faster and kite efficient solutions. In this workshop, you'll learn about the evolution of ecommerce and how Jamstack and headless commerce evolves shopping experiences on the web. We will explore the basics of headless commerce by building a minimal Jamstack ecommerce product page with static content, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Finally, we will integrate Commerce Layer for headless commerce capabilities and deploy our application to Netlify.
