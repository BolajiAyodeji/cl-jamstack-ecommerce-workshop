## A quick introduction to Jamstack

Jamstack (Javascript, APIs, and Markup) is a modern architecture used to build modern web applications. With the Jamstack, websites become just plain HTML pages pre-generated by a static site generator during build time and are deployed to a CDN. Content can be created as markdown or plain text, wrapped around a template, and built into a static site. Server-side functionalities and dynamic content are encapsulated into APIs. These APIs are plugged into the application and still served as plain HTML pages. Hence, there is room for more flexibility and the use of third-party APIs to enhance development. Content can also be managed independently with the help of a headless content management system. This amazing development flow unlocks a lot of speed, performance, user experience, and developer experience advantages.

## A quick introduction to headless commerce

Headless commerce is a new approach that solves all the challenges in traditional commerce. This approach decouples components, as seen in the monolithic ecommerce application, into independent modules. Hence, the frontend layer (the head) is separated from the backend, allowing more flexibility, better performance, and efficient development. With the headless approach, developers independently build the presentation layer, backend (business logic), database layer, integrations and utilize the various headless commerce API solutions. Since the presentation layer is decoupled from the backend, developers can serve omnichannel experiences to users on several platforms with the same code and content with no interruption to the customer experience.

## Setup project directory

1. Create an `index.html` file in the root directory.
2. Create a `/css` directory and a `custom.css` file in it.
3. Create a `/src` directory and a `main.js` file in it.

We'll add more files as we proceed üòâ.

## Install required packages

1. Run the `npm init` command and initialize a `package.json` file.
2. Copy and paste this into the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "CL Static Commerce Demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "./dist/commercelayer.min.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "rm -rf ./dist && webpack --progress --watch --mode=development",
    "build": "rm -rf ./dist && webpack --progress"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop.git"
  },
  "keywords": ["commerce layer", "jamstack", "headless", "ecommerce", "api"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop#readme",
  "dependencies": {
    "@commercelayer/js-auth": "^2.0.2",
    "@commercelayer/js-sdk": "^2.14.3",
    "js-cookie": "^2.2.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.20"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.11.6",
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread": "^7.11.0",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime": "^7.11.5",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.11.5",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^4.5.0",
    "webpack": "^4.44.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

3. Now run `npm install` to install all packages in the `package.json` file.

## Setup webpack

We would be having multiple JavaScript files with modules and all. So we need to compile them all into one minified JS file we can drop into our `index.html` file. To do this, we need to setup webpack, babel and some plugins (which you've installed already from the previous step). Kindly create a `webpack.config.js` file which will contain the configuration and paste the code below:

```js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/main.js",
  devtool: "source-map",
  output: {
    filename: "commercelayer.min.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js", ".json"],
    modules: ["node_modules", path.resolve(__dirname, "src")],
    symlinks: false,
  },
  devServer: {
    https: true,
    compress: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?(js|ts)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "babel-loader",
            options: {
              presets: ["@babel/preset-env"],
              plugins: ["@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "index.html",
    }),
  ],
};
```

We can now add the `commercelayer.min.js` to the bottom section of the `index.html` file like so:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/commercelayer.min.js"></script>
```

## Setup Commerce Layer developer account

1. Head to [https://core.commercelayer.io/users/sign_up](https://core.commercelayer.io/users/sign_up) to create a free developer account.
2. Create a new [organization](https://commercelayer.io/docs/data-model/users-and-organizations/) for your business.
3. You can decide to seed your organization with test data manually or wait for the next section where I show you how to do that with the CLI.
4. If you skipped the seeding, you'll be prompted to complete a checklist of items because your organization requires a market and something to sell before you get the first order.

## Setup [Commerce Layer CLI](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli)

The official Commerce Layer CLI which helps you to manage your Commerce Layer applications right from the terminal.

1. Run the command below to install the CLI using your favorite package manager:

```bash
//npm
npm install -g @commercelayer/commercelayer-cli

//yarn
yarn global add @commercelayer/commercelayer-cli
```

Installing the CLI provides access to the commercelayer, clayer, and cl command.

2. In your Commerce Layer dashboard, head to **Settings > Applications** and create two applications with the following `name` and `kind` values respectively: Website, sales_chanel and CLI, cli (`kind` determines the authentication flow and set of permissions of the application).

> Upon a succesful creation, you'll get a _CREDENTIALS_ section added to the application with `CLIENT ID` and `ENDPOINT` for the _sales_channel_ and `CLIENT ID`, `CLIENT SECRET` and `ENDPOINT` for the _cli_. We'll use this to interact with our application later.

3. Login to your application via the CLI using the previously created CLI credentials like so:

```bash
commercelayer app:login -o <organizationSlug> -i <clientId> -s <clientSecret>
```

## Seed organization with test data using the CLI

Like I mentioned earlier, you can seed your organization with a set of products (SKUs), related prices, and inventory via the CLI.

1. Install the seeder plugin using the command below:

```bash
commercelayer plugins:install seeder
```

2. Generate an access token for your application using the command below:

```bash
commercelayer app:token
```

2. Seed your organization using the command below:

```bash
cl seed
```

The CLI will use Commerce Layer's [default seed](https://data.commercelayer.app/seed) as your `resourcesUrl`. If you want to seed with your own resources, you can pass the URL like so:

```bash
cl seed -u <resourcesUrl> | <seedUrl>
```

## Build product page structure

Now let's build our product page with the product details, fetch prices, available variants, available quantity, and availability of the item.

### Setup required configuration

Add the code below to `index.html` and add the required secrets:

```html
<!-- Config -->
<div
  id="clayer-config"
  data-base-url="<yourOrganizationUrl>"
  data-cache="true"
  data-client-id="<yourClientId>"
  data-market-id="<yourMarketId>"
  data-country-code="US"
  data-language-code="en"
  data-cart-url="https://example.com/cart"
  data-return-url="https://example.com/return"
  data-privacy-url="https://example.com/privacy"
  data-terms-url="https://example.com/terms"
  data-dev-settings-debug="true"
  data-dev-settings-console="true"
  data-dev-settings-trace="true"
></div>
```

Create a `config.js` file in `src` directory and add the code below:

```js
const clayerConfig = document.querySelector("#clayer-config");

let config = {
  baseUrl: "",
  clientId: "",
  marketId: "",
  countryCode: "",
  languageCode: "",
  devSettings: {
    debug: "",
    console: "",
    trace: "",
  },
};

if (clayerConfig) {
  config = {
    baseUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-base-url"),
    clientId: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-client-id"),
    marketId: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-market-id"),
    countryCode: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-country-code"),
    languageCode: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-language-code").split("-")[0],
    devSettings: {
      debug: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-debug"),
      console: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-console"),
      trace: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-trace"),
    },
  };
}

export default config;
```

### Add staic product page

## Integrating Commerce Layer

Now let's integrate Commerce Layer into our static product apage for headless commerce capabilities. TBA in the live workshop.

## Continous Deployment on Netlify

Now let's push our project to GitHub and deploy to Netlify. Everytime you push any change to GitHub, Netlify will run your build and re-deploy the repository again. You can follow the steps below or [watch this video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-deploy-a-site-to-netlify-from-git) to setup continous deployment on Netlify.

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com) (if you haven't yet).
2. Create a [new GitHub repository](http://github.new) and [push](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line) the finished project.
3. Create a [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup) (if you haven't).
4. Click the **New site from Git** button in your dashboard to deploy the repository from GitHub.
5. Link Netlify to your GitHub and select the repository you want to deploy.
6. Configure your settings and ensure your publish directory is set to `/` unless otherwise.
7. Click the **Deploy site** button to continue and you're done!

## Deploy to Netlify using the CLI

1. Install Netlify CLI globally with the command below:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

2. Autehticate Netlify with the command below:

```bash
netlify login
```

3. Setup continous deployment with the command below:

```bash
netlify init
```

Learn more about the Netlify CLI from this [comprehensive getting started guide](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/).

## Bonus: Place an order via the Commerce Layer CLI

Since this workshop doesn't cover how to checkout your shopping bag and actually place the order. Let's place the order completely using the Commerce Layer CLI in a few steps. Click [here](https://gist.github.com/silviorelli/93424c7e0483780dc5c51fe7a3d215c1) for the step-by-step guide.

## Conclusion

It's dangerous to have unsatisfied customers in this modern, competitive, and fast-evolving age. Hence, new and modern architectures are needed to eliminate factors causing dissatisfaction and improve the business and technical logic in commerce. If you're looking to build global ecommerce web experiences, you should also check out the [Commerce Layer Sanity Starter](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=commercelayer/sanity-template-commercelayer) ‚Äì a multi-country ecommerce starter built with Sanity Studio, Commerce Layer, Next.js, and deployed to Netlify. You can also [contribute](https://github.com/commercelayer/sanity-template-commercelayer) to the development of the starter.

We developed an [open source checkout application](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-checkout) that can be used as it is or as a reference in case you need to develop a custom checkout experience through the API. This application provides you with a PCI-compliant, PSD2-compliant, and production-ready checkout flow that lets you easily place orders through the Commerce Layer API.
