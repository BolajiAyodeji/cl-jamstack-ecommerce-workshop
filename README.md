# Jamstack eCommerce 101

Digital commerce has changed, and there is an increasing demand for faster and kite efficient solutions. In this workshop, you'll learn about the evolution of ecommerce and how Jamstack and headless commerce evolves shopping experiences on the web. We will explore the basics of headless commerce by building a minimal Jamstack ecommerce product page with static content, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Finally, we will integrate Commerce Layer for headless commerce capabilities and deploy our application to Netlify.

## Quick introduction to headless commerce

Headless commerce is a new approach that solves all the challenges in traditional commerce. This approach decouples components, as seen in the monolithic ecommerce application, into independent modules. Hence, the frontend layer (the head) is separated from the backend, allowing more flexibility, better performance, and efficient development.

With the headless approach, developers independently build the presentation layer, backend (business logic), database layer, integrations and utilize the various headless commerce API solutions. Since the presentation layer is decoupled from the backend, developers can serve omnichannel experiences to users on several platforms with the same code and content. One great advantage of the headless commerce approach is deploying changes frequently, with little or no work required on the backend and no interruption to the customer experience.

## Setup project directory

1. Create an `index.html` file in the root directory.
2. Create a `/css` directory and a `custom.css` file in it.
3. Create a `/src` directory and a `main.js` file in it.

We'll add more files as we proceed ðŸ˜‰.

## Install required packages

1. Run the `npm init` command and initialize a `package.json` file.
2. Copy and paste this into the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "CL Static Commerce Demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "./dist/commercelayer.min.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "rm -rf ./dist && webpack --progress --watch --mode=development",
    "build": "rm -rf ./dist && webpack --progress"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop.git"
  },
  "keywords": ["commerce layer", "jamstack", "headless", "ecommerce", "api"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/cl-jamstack-ecommerce-workshop#readme",
  "dependencies": {
    "@commercelayer/js-auth": "^2.0.2",
    "@commercelayer/js-sdk": "^2.14.3",
    "js-cookie": "^2.2.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.20"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.11.6",
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread": "^7.11.0",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime": "^7.11.5",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.11.5",
    "babel-loader": "^8.1.0",
    "clean-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.0",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^4.5.0",
    "webpack": "^4.44.2",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.3.12",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.11.0"
  }
}
```

3. Now run `npm install` to install all packages in the `package.json` file.

## Setup webpack

We would be having multiple JavaScript files with modules and all. So we need to compile them all into one minified JS file we can drop into our `index.html` file.

To do this, we need to setup webpack, babel and some plugins (which you've installed already from the previous step). Kindly create a `webpack.config.js` file which will contain the configuration and paste the code below:

```js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/main.js",
  devtool: "source-map",
  output: {
    filename: "commercelayer.min.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js", ".json"],
    modules: ["node_modules", path.resolve(__dirname, "src")],
    symlinks: false,
  },
  devServer: {
    https: true,
    compress: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?(js|ts)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: "babel-loader",
            options: {
              presets: ["@babel/preset-env"],
              plugins: ["@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "index.html",
    }),
  ],
};
```

We can now add the `commercelayer.min.js` to the bottom section of the `index.html` file like so:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/commercelayer.min.js"></script>
```

## Setup Commerce Layer developer account

1. Head to [https://core.commercelayer.io/users/sign_up](https://core.commercelayer.io/users/sign_up) to create a free developer account.
2. Create a new [organization](https://commercelayer.io/docs/data-model/users-and-organizations/) for your business.
3. You can decide to seed your organization with test data manually or wait for the next section where I show you how to do that with the CLI.
4. If you skipped the seeding, you'll be prompted to complete a checklist of items because your organization requires a market and something to sell before you get the first order.

## Setting up [Commerce Layer CLI](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-cli)

The official Commerce Layer CLI which helps you to manage your Commerce Layer applications right from the terminal.

1. Run the command below to install the CLI using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install -g @commercelayer/commercelayer-cli
```

```bash
yarn global add @commercelayer/commercelayer-cli

```

Installing the CLI provides access to the commercelayer, clayer, and cl command.

2. In your Commerce Layer dashboard, head to **Settings > Applications** and create two applications with the following `name` and `kind` values respectively: Website, sales_chanel and CLI, cli (`kind` determines the authentication flow and set of permissions of the application).

> Upon a succesful creation, you'll get a _CREDENTIALS_ section added to the application with `CLIENT ID` and `ENDPOINT` for the _sales_channel_ and `CLIENT ID`, `CLIENT SECRET` and `ENDPOINT` for the _cli_. We'll use this to interact with our application later.

3. Login to your application via the CLI using the previously created CLI credentials like so:

```bash
commercelayer app:login -o <organizationSlug> -i <clientId> -s <clientSecret>
```

## Seed organization with test data using the CLI

Like I mentioned earlier, you can seed your organization with a set of products (SKUs), related prices, and inventory via the CLI.

1. Install the seeder plugin using the command below:

```bash
commercelayer plugins:install seeder
```

2. Generate an access token for your application using the command below:

```bash
commercelayer app:token
```

2. Seed your organization using the command below:

```bash
cl seed
```

The CLI will use Commerce Layer's [default seed](https://data.commercelayer.app/seed) as your `resourcesUrl`. If you want to seed with your own resources, you can pass the URL like so:

```bash
cl seed -u <resourcesUrl> | <seedUrl>
```

## Build product page structure

Now let's build our product page with the product details, fetch prices, available variants, available quantity, and availability of the item.

### Setup required configuration

Add the code below to `index.html` and add the required secrets:

```html
<!-- Config -->
<div
  id="clayer-config"
  data-base-url="<yourOrganizationUrl>"
  data-cache="true"
  data-client-id="<yourClientId>"
  data-market-id="<yourMarketId>"
  data-country-code="US"
  data-language-code="en"
  data-cart-url="https://example.com/cart"
  data-return-url="https://example.com/return"
  data-privacy-url="https://example.com/privacy"
  data-terms-url="https://example.com/terms"
  data-dev-settings-debug="true"
  data-dev-settings-console="true"
  data-dev-settings-trace="true"
></div>
```

Create a `config.js` file in `src` directory and add the code below:

```js
const clayerConfig = document.querySelector("#clayer-config");

let config = {
  baseUrl: "",
  clientId: "",
  marketId: "",
  countryCode: "",
  languageCode: "",
  cartUrl: "",
  returnUrl: "",
  privacyUrl: "",
  termsUrl: "",
  devSettings: {
    debug: "",
    console: "",
    trace: "",
  },
};

if (clayerConfig) {
  config = {
    baseUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-base-url"),
    clientId: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-client-id"),
    marketId: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-market-id"),
    countryCode: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-country-code"),
    languageCode: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-language-code").split("-")[0],
    cartUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-cart-url"),
    returnUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-return-url"),
    privacyUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-privacy-url"),
    termsUrl: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-terms-url"),
    devSettings: {
      debug: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-debug"),
      console: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-console"),
      trace: clayerConfig.getAttribute("data-dev-settings-trace"),
    },
  };
}

export default config;
```

## Conclusion

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

We developed an [open source checkout application](). It can be used as is or as a reference in case you need to develop a custom checkout experience through the API, to fully match your branding requirements or your clients' ones.

If you're looking to build global ecommerce web experiences, you should also check out the [Commerce Layer Sanity Starter](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=commercelayer/sanity-template-commercelayer) â€“ a multi-country ecommerce starter built with Sanity Studio, Commerce Layer, Next.js, and deployed to Netlify. You can also [contribute](https://github.com/commercelayer/sanity-template-commercelayer) to the development of the starter.
